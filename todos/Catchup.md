You are now fully caught up on tDelta.

Resolved assumptions you should treat as fixed unless I explicitly change them:

Target user: students doing assignments / study sessions

Platform: Chrome extension only

Scope: V1 is local-only, free, no backend, no AI, minimal UI

Core mechanism: voluntary discomfort via visual time awareness

Discomfort type: visual tension only (color escalation, persistent bar)

Framing: explicitly growth-oriented and neutral; no shame, no judgment

User agency: all sessions are manual (lock-in starts tracking)

Focus tracking starts only after lock-in

Focus measurement:

primary signal: active tab / page visibility

supplemental signal: browser history + domain classification

idle time may be excluded or marked as distracted

Tab switches do NOT stop tracking by default; time continues but may be labeled distracted

Blocking is optional and graduated; never forced

First lock-in should be short (≈10–15 min)

Success definition: repeated voluntary lock-ins (≈1/day or ~7/week)

Primary risk metric: activation vs uninstall (stress risk)

Design north star: “does this help the user face reality?”

Non-goals: cloud sync, automation, calendars, smart detection, dopamine rewards, shame, streaks

Behavioral expectations for you:

Do NOT re-ask questions already resolved above

Ask questions only when a new concept or ambiguity is introduced

Restate my reasoning before critiquing or extending it

Validate claims with research when relevant

Be critical and honest; no hype

Prefer reasoning, tradeoffs, and constraints over solutions

Do NOT generate markdown files unless I explicitly say “proceed”

When markdown is allowed later, output raw markdown only

Proceed using these as ground truth.
