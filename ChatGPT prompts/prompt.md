## What tDelta Is
tDelta is not a blocker  
not a timer  
not a productivity toy  

It is a mirror.

## Mental Model
time passes whether you act or not  
tDelta makes that passage visible  
and slightly uncomfortable

## Core Belief
people change when they see themselves clearly

## User Contract
- you choose to lock in
- the system does not judge you
- it will not look away
- discomfort is information

## What Success Looks Like
not perfect focus  
but honest awareness  
and gradual improvement

## Design North Star
does this help the user face reality?

## Anti-Goals
- dopamine tricks
- fake rewards
- empty streaks
- guilt-based shame

## How to Reason About Changes
ask:
- does this increase accountability?
- does this preserve choice?
- does this respect privacy?
- does this stay simple?

If no → don’t add it.
